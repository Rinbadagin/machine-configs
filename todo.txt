Add tailscale auth key to file (find where it's kept? probably not the preauthkey...)
figure out how to do the same thing with the other headscale clients. klara.nz, eliza.nz, fem.nz host - those can be migrated to nixos and then have workloads transferred to them (by zones of disuse)
configure k3s server in aus
set up longhorn (tagging)
